## Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   Access to MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
*   A Firebase Project

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials.

```env
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string_here"
MONGODB_DB_NAME="your_mongodb_database_name_here"

# Firebase Configuration (client-side keys are in src/lib/firebase.ts)
# For Genkit with Google AI, you'll need a Google AI API Key.
# Ensure this is set in your environment where the Genkit server runs.
# GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_ai_api_key_for_genkit" (if not using Application Default Credentials)

# Base URL of your deployed application (used for metadata, etc.)
# For local development:
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:9002"
# For production, set this to your actual domain:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
```

**Note on Firebase Client Configuration:** The client-side Firebase configuration is located in `src/lib/firebase.ts`. For enhanced security in production, consider moving these to `NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variables and referencing them in `src/lib/firebase.ts`.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pandashreyan/Ballotbox-app.git
    cd Ballotbox-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

## Database Setup

*   **MongoDB:**
    *   Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running.
    *   Update `MONGODB_URI` and `MONGODB_DB_NAME` in your `.env` file.
    *   Collections (`elections`) will be created automatically as the app runs.
*   **Firebase Firestore:**
    *   Set up a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Enable **Firestore** in your Firebase project (Native mode).
    *   Enable **Email/Password** sign-in method in Firebase Authentication.
    *   Copy your Firebase project's web configuration details into `src/lib/firebase.ts`.
    *   **Important:** Configure Firestore Security Rules for production to restrict access appropriately (e.g., only admins can modify certain fields, users can only update their own profiles). The current `firestore.rules` might be basic and need review.
    *   The necessary Firestore indexes are defined in `firestore.indexes.json`. You may need to deploy these via the Firebase CLI or allow Firestore to auto-create them (which can take time).

## Running the Application

The application requires two separate terminal processes to run concurrently in development:

1.  **Run the Next.js Development Server:**
    This serves the frontend and Next.js API routes.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The Next.js app will typically start on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Run the Genkit Development Server (in a separate terminal):**
    This server handles the execution of AI flows (like platform summarization and the chatbot).
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or, for auto-reloading Genkit flows on changes:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    The Genkit server usually starts on `http://localhost:3400` (check your console output).

Visit `http://localhost:9002` (or your configured port) in your browser to use the application.

## Authentication & Roles

*   **Voters and Candidates:** Register and log in using Firebase Authentication (Email/Password). Their respective Firestore documents (`voters/{uid}` or `candidates/{uid}`) store role-specific information and statuses.
*   **Admin:** Admin functionality is primarily accessed via a mock role selection in the header dropdown. This is for development and testing convenience. Selecting "Admin" via the dropdown signs out any active Firebase user and sets a mock admin context.
*   **Role Switching:** The header dropdown allows switching between mock roles (Admin, Candidate, Voter, Guest/Logout) to test different parts of theapplication. If a Firebase user is logged in, switching to "Admin" or a mock "Candidate" will sign out the Firebase user. Switching to a mock "Voter" will also sign out the Firebase user.

## Available Scripts

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server (with Turbopack).
*   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server.
*   `npm run genkit:watch`: Starts the Genkit development server with file watching for auto-reloads.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the Next.js application for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the Next.js production server (after `npm run build`).
*   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
*   `npm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking.

## Deployment

For deploying this Next.js application, platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (by the creators of Next.js) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) are highly recommended due to their excellent Next.js support.

1.  **Push your code to a Git provider** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2.  **Connect your Git repository** to your chosen hosting platform.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables** on the hosting platform (ensure all variables from your `.env` file, including `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for Genkit and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, are set).
4.  **Build Command:** Typically `npm run build` or `next build`.
5.  **Publish Directory:** Usually `.next`.
6.  **Deploying Genkit Flows:** Genkit flows are part of the Next.js server-side code and will be deployed with your Next.js application. Ensure any necessary API keys (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) are set as environment variables on your hosting platform where the serverless functions/server will run.
